# Flask Web Application with Bootstrap Styling

## Description
This project is a Flask web application that incorporates various features such as routing, form handling, file upload functionality, API endpoints, and styling using Bootstrap. 
It serves as a demonstration of building a web application using Flask, a micro web framework for Python, along with Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework for front-end development.

## Features
1. **Basic Routing:** The application includes routes for the home page, an about page, form submission, file upload, and API endpoints.
2. **Form Handling:** Users can submit a form with their name and email, which is then displayed on a new page.
3. **File Upload:** Users can upload files, which are saved on the server and displayed on another page.
